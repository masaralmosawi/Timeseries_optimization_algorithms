# timeseries and optimization algorithms
Research project within machine learning and optimization algorithms using optimization algorithms. Timeseries in the time domain and freqency domain are analysed, AR- and ARMA-process. Develop and further investigate optimization algorithms for the purpose of machine learning in AI development. The code is in Julia and R.
